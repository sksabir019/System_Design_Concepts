## Design Principles

Design principles are fundamental guidelines that help shape the structure, behavior, and aesthetics of systems, products, or processes. They provide a foundation for making design decisions that lead to effective, efficient, and maintainable solutions.

## Definition
**Design principles** are a set of rules or guidelines that inform and direct the design process, ensuring consistency, usability, and quality in the final outcome.

## Types of Design Principles

1. **SOLID Principles** (for software design):
    - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
    - **O**pen/Closed Principle
    - **L**iskov Substitution Principle
    - **I**nterface Segregation Principle
    - **D**ependency Inversion Principle

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplication by ensuring that every piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous representation.

3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Strive for simplicity in design and implementation.

4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Do not implement features until they are actually needed.

5. **General Design Principles:**
    - **Modularity:** Breaking a system into smaller, manageable components.
    - **Scalability:** Ability to handle growth efficiently.
    - **Maintainability:** Ease of updating and fixing the system.
    - **Reusability:** Designing components for use in multiple contexts.
    - **Simplicity:** Keeping designs straightforward and easy to understand.
    - **Consistency:** Ensuring uniformity across the system.

6. **User Experience (UX) Principles:**
    - **Usability:** Making systems easy to use.
    - **Accessibility:** Ensuring systems are usable by people with varying abilities.
    - **Feedback:** Providing clear responses to user actions.

Design principles guide designers and engineers to create robust, user-friendly, and scalable systems.
